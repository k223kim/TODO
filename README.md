	- [x] Doubly linked list
Some ideas
- Convert primeagen's kata-machine in python
	- for my personal use

Thoughts
- try to focus on specific topics and avoid to expand my interest at this point as I have a target goal
- do i have to learn Go? will it be somewhat meaningful?
- my main priorities in tech skills
	- algorithms
	- ML
	- DB
	- backend nest
	- docker
	- github
	- ci/cd
