## TODO
## 2024-02-22
- [x] Learn about github actions
## 2024-02-23
- [x] Set up TODO
	- [x] Want to have separate files for each date
	- [x] Can merge all the separate .md files to README.md
	- [x] Automatically update this using Obsidian
- [ ] Write a blog post about github actions
- [ ] Write react native android TFLite inference code
- [ ] Write code to split train-val for ternary classification model considering the departments

## 2024-02-26
- [x] create yolo dataset (split train, val depending on department)
- [x] train yolo classification model
- [ ] 유정님께 데이터 셋 검수 부탁드리기
- [ ] conduct inference of classification model on the android app (react native)
- [x] Learn about NestJS modules
- [x] get started with primeagen's algorithm course
	- [x] hour and a half (7:00 - 8:30)
	- [x] Linear search, binary search, bubble sort, linked list
	- [x] Doubly linked list
Some ideas
- Convert primeagen's kata-machine in python
	- for my personal use

Thoughts
- try to focus on specific topics and avoid to expand my interest at this point as I have a target goal
- do i have to learn Go? will it be somewhat meaningful?
- my main priorities in tech skills
	- algorithms
	- ML
	- DB
	- backend nest
	- docker
	- github
	- ci/cd
## 2024-02-27
- [ ] create kids test dataset
- [x] analyze on test set
- [x] oversample classification dataset
- [x] do more kata-machine-python
	- [x] get everything setup to run live (at least linear search)
- [x] study algorithms
	- [x] up to ring buffer at least
- [ ] study nestJS modules
## 2024-02-28
- [ ] continue oversampling and potentially train model

	- [x] included binary search, queue, stack
## 2024-02-29
- [x] study algorithms
	- [x] mostly reviewing doubly linked list, stack, queue, maze solver, quick and bubble sort
- [x] start studying postgresql
- [ ] change data preprocessing code to be multiprocessing
- [ ] fine tune yolo on one department
- [ ] try spliting by date and update result analysis
